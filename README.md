#  Elecalc
## Description
Elecalc is designed to be an electronic engineering calculator for iOS/iPadOS (possibly for Mac in the future), written in Swift and SwiftUI.

## Features
- Calculations for resistors and capacitors in parallel and series
- Component calculations (e.g. LED and heatsink calculations)
- Conversions (e.g. decibel to numeric gain)

## Requirements
- An iPhone or iPad running iOS/iPadOS 13.5 or newer (compatible devices - iPhone 6S or later, iPad 5th generation or newer, iPad Mini 4 or newer, all iPad Pro models and iPod touch 7th generation)
    - You can also use the Xcode simulator to test the app, as long as the simulator is running iOS 13.5 or newer.
- I have been using Xcode 12 GM to incorporate iOS 14 features, so you may need to update to Xcode 12 to build properly (requires a Mac running macOS 10.15.6 or later)

## Installing
The project should build and install like any iOS Xcode project - see [the Apple developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running_your_app_in_the_simulator_or_on_a_device) for details.

## Future additions
I am open to feature requests - if anyone has any, please add them to the "Issues" tab, prefixing with [Feature Request].

This project is licensed under the MIT License - please see LICENSE.md for more information.
